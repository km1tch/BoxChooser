# Default Packaging Guidelines
# Simple structure: one rule per packing type

# Recommendation engine configuration
recommendation_engine:
  # Scoring weights (must sum to 1.0)
  weights:
    price: 0.45 # 45% - Cost optimization
    efficiency: 0.50 # 50% - Space utilization
    ease: 0.05 #  5% - Packing complexity

  # Strategy preferences (0-10 scale, lower = more preferred)
  strategy_preferences:
    normal: 0 # No modifications needed
    prescored: 0 # Pre-scored cuts (easy)
    flattened: 2 # Flat pack for thin items
    manual_cut: 9 # Manual cutting required
    telescoping: 6 # Multiple boxes needed
    cheating: 5 # Diagonal packing

  # Thresholds and limits
  practically_tight_threshold: 5 # Score difference for "practically tight" boxes
  max_recommendations: 10 # Maximum recommendations to show
  extreme_cut_threshold: 0.5 # Min ratio of remaining box after cut (50%)
